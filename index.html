  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p> I went to the following schools:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Kamagut High School</li>
      <li>Sunview Academy</li>
      <li>Hill School</li>
    </ul>
  <p>My decision on taking programming is because i was interested in <br>learning <em>Artificial Intelligence.</em>Its actually very fun to create an AI <br>that is responsive and can actually think for itself and can behave like<br> a human being.It can remind you of what you forgot to do and also one <br>of the biggest thing it can do which will take time to create is managing a<br> small business like key decision making.One can talk to the AI during like<br> my downtime.So,i had to start with the basic of programming before <br>advancing to<span class="two"> machine learning languages</span> and data science.AI was my interest <br>that is why i joined programming AI.</p>
